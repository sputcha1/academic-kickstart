The [STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) (CDT) is a joint partnership between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and the Department of Management Science at Lancaster University. The primary aim of the CDT is to offer a four-year Doctoral Training Programme in Statistics and Operational Research, with a specific focus on solving problems for industry.

I am now a final year PhD student at STOR-i, having completed the [MRes](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/stor-i-programme/mres/#) (first) year of the programme in 2018. The first year at STOR-i provides students with the training that they require in order to successfully undertake a PhD. Prior to joining full time, I completed a summer internship at the CDT.

STOR-i is funded by the [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](https://epsrc.ukri.org/) (EPSRC), which funds CDTs in various disciplines across the country.
