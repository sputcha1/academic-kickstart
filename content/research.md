### PhD Research: Scalable Monte Carlo in the general Big Data setting
_Supervised by Dr. Chris Nemeth (Lancaster University) and Prof. Paul Fearnhead (Lancaster University)_

Monte Carlo methods are often required to produce exact inference and to evaluate models in the Bayesian setting. These algorithms are widely implemented by scientists and industrial practitioners, due to their versatility and strong theoretical properties.

Unfortunately, standard Monte Carlo algorithms are ill-suited for conducting inference on large datasets. This is because they require complete evaluations of the full data at each iteration, leading to a computational cost that increases (at the very least) proportionally with the data size. These issues have prompted considerable interest amongst the machine learning and statistics communities to develop Bayesian inference methods which can scale easily in relation to the size of the data. 

My research focuses on developing scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. The first preprint from my PhD is available to read [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10568)
